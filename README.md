# Fanhub

Fanhub is a Fan Filmsâ€™ streaming Website created during an intensive week at HETIC (Web School).
The main purpose of the platform was building a solid community of Fan Films and giving the opportunity to users to upload their own film.
Front-end features are coded in pure Javascript and the upload film section in Node.JS.
